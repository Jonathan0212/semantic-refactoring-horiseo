## Changes Made
* Gave the webpage a title 
* When viewing the html code it is more organized with semantic elements
* Styles page follows the web page, everything follows the structure of the page
* Every image has a alt attribute 
* Added comments to styles page and html code to making reading easier
* Both styles page and html code are neatly spaced out
